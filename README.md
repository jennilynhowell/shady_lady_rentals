# Shady Lady Beach Rentals

## Project Objectives
This project represents the culmination of my studies at The Iron Yard in Greenville, SC. I successfully completed a Full-Stack Engineering program in August 2017 and am building this application as both a demonstration of my skills and an exercise in continued learning.

#### About this application
This app is built on the Java Spring platform. Below is a list of requirements for this app:
1. Include a web application written in Java Spring Boot.
1. Use data stored in a database.
Integrate with at least one "outside" data store or API.
    1. Investigate RESTful call in Java.
1. Provide an API to at minimum query data.
1. Be useful in some way, not just a direct clone of something that already exists. Add value or a niche to an existing application.
1. Use at least one technology or package we haven't covered in class.
1. Be achievable by you in the four week project period.
1. Have code available in github.
1. Be deployed on the public Internet, with a service like Amazon Web Services or Heroku.

#### My goals for this application + more details
1. Fully functional e-commerce application
    1. PostgreSQL database will store information about inventory, customers, and orders.
    1. Investigate whether Spring Web Flow is the best option for scheduling/checkout processes.
    1. Integrate a Maps (and/or Weather)functionality as part of UX
1. Attractive UI utilizing Materialize
1. API that will allow admins to update inventory and view/edit orders
1. iOS integration

#### Timeline Goals

* Week 2: Implement Spring Web Flow and Maps/Weather. Work on UI. Deploy.
* Week 3: Fix bugs, polish UI. Deploy, deploy, deploy.
* Week 4: Get something working on iOS.


## Business Objectives
#### Who?
Shady Lady Rentals is a boutique beach rental firm that provides large canopies, coolers, and other beach necessities to families visiting Charleston's beaches.

#### What?
Custom beach rentals. Customers can select a number of items/services for their day at the beach, and SLR will have the order ready when the family arrives at the beach that morning.

#### Where?
Charleston, SC beaches: Sullivan's Island, Isle of Palms, and Folly Beach.

#### Why?
Vacationing families would like to enjoy a full day at the beach without the hassles of:
1. Too little shade. Umbrellas and small tents do not provide enough protection for the whole family.
1. Too much stuff to manage. Chairs, tents, coolers, games... You shouldn't need to haul 100lb of gear to the beach each day.

#### How?
Functional, engaging, user-friendly software will enable the following:
1. Prospective customers can learn about SLR's services and equipment offerings.
1. Customers can reserve their beach equipment.
1. Employees will receive orders and a list of items to load in preparation for the next day's reservations.
1. Employees and customers will be able to contact each other easily through a messaging/call-now platform.
